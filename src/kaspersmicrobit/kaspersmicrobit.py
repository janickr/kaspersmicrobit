class KaspersMicrobit:
    """
    This is the class you can use to connect to a micro:bit.
    You can do this:

    - read data about the micro:bit
    - read data from the sensors of the micro:bit or be notified of data from sensors
    - control components on the micro:bit, for example the LEDs

    Example:
    ```python
    with KaspersMicrobit.find_one_microbit() as microbit:
        microbit.buttons.on_button_a(press=pressed, long_press=pressed_long, up=released)
        microbit.temperature.notify(lambda temp: print(f'{temp}°C'))
        time.sleep(25)
    ```

    ```python
    microbit = KaspersMicrobit.find_one_microbit()
    try:
        microbit.connect()
        microbit.buttons.on_button_a(press=pressed, long_press=pressed_long, up=released)
        microbit.temperature.notify(lambda temp: print(f'{temp}°C'))
        time.sleep(25)
    finally:
        microbit.disconnect()
    ```

    Attributes:
        device_information (DeviceInformationService):
            To request information about the maker of your micro:bit
        generic_access (GenericAccessService):
            To request information about your micro:bit
        buttons (ButtonService):
            To notify you when one of the two buttons on the micro:bit is pressed (or released)
        temperature (TemperatureService):
            To request the temperature of the environment of the micro:bit (or to be notified)
        accelerometer (AccelerometerService):
            To notify you of acceleration (movement, collision,...) of the micro:bit
        events (EventService):
            To subscribe to receive events from various components of the micro:bit
        uart (UartService):
            To send or receive text to the micro:bit
        io_pin (IOPinService):
            Control, read, configure the I/O contacts (pins) on the micro:bit
        led (LedService):
            Control the LEDs of the micro:bit
        magnetometer (MagnetometerService):
            To read the data from the magnetometer, or to be notified. The magnetometer measures
            the magnetic field in the vicinity of the micro:bit (e.g. the magnetic field of the earth)

        Troubleshooting:
            First try turning the micro:bit off and on again.

            If you are not using the "with"-block, but calling .connect() yourself, always make sure that in any case
            you call .disconnect() when you don't need the connection anymore
            (for instance when you exit your application)

            - In case you are using "No pairing required":
              Make sure the micro:bit is not paired to your computer, if it was, remove it from the paired bluetooth
              devices
            - In case you are using "Just works pairing":
              Try to remove the micro:bit from the paired bluetooth devices and pairing it your computer again.
