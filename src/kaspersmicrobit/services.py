    A generic, bi-directional event communication service. 

    The Event Service allows events or commands to be notified to the micro:bit by a connected client and it allows 
    micro:bit to notify the connected client of events or commands originating from with the micro:bit. The micro:bit 
    can inform the client of the types of event it is interested in being informed about (e.g. an incoming call) and 
    the client can inform the micro:bit of types of event it wants to be notified about.  
    
    The term “event” will be used here for both event and command types of data.
    
    Events may have an associated value.
    
    Note that specific event ID values including any special values such as those which may represent wild cards are 
    not defined here. The micro:bit run time documentation should be consulted for this information.
    
    Multiple events of different types may be notified to the client or micro:bit at the same time.
    Event data is encoded as an array of structs each encoding an event of a given type together with an associated 
    value. Event Type and Event Value are both defined as uint16 and therefore the length of this array will always be 
    a multiple of 4.
